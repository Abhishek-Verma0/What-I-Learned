## Data Persistence in Docker
Docker enables you to run containers that are isolated pieces of code, including applications and their dependencies, separated from the host operating system. Containers are ephemeral by default, which means any data stored in the container will be lost once it is terminated. To overcome this problem and retain data across container lifecycles, Docker provides various data persistence methods.

In this section, we will cover:

- Docker Volumes
- Bind Mounts
- Docker tmpfs mounts
### Docker Volumes
Docker volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated and utilized by a Docker container. A volume is a directory on the host machine Docker uses to store files and directories that can outlive the container’s lifecycle. Docker volumes can be shared among containers, and they offer various benefits like easy backups and data migration.

To create a volume, use the following command:
```
docker volume create volume_name
```
To use a volume, add a --volume (or -v) flag to your docker run command:
```
docker run --volume volume_name:/container/path image_name
```
### Bind Mounts
Bind mounts allow you to map any directory on the host machine to a directory within the container. This method can be useful in development environments where you need to modify files on the host system, and those changes should be immediately available within the container.

To create a bind mount, use the --mount flag with type=bind in your docker run command:
```
docker run --mount type=bind,src=/host/path,dst=/container/path image_name
```
### Docker tmpfs mounts
Docker tmpfs mounts allow you to create a temporary file storage directly in the container’s memory. Data stored in tmpfs mounts is fast and secure but will be lost once the container is terminated.

To use a tmpfs mount, add a --tmpfs flag to your docker run command:
```
docker run --tmpfs /container/path image_name
```
By employing these methods, you can ensure data persistence across container lifecycles, enhancing the usefulness and flexibility of Docker containers. Remember to choose the method that best suits your use case, whether it’s the preferred Docker volumes, convenient bind mounts, or fast and secure tmpfs mounts.

### Ephemeral FS
By default, the storage within a Docker container is ephemeral, meaning that any data changes or modifications made inside a container will only persist as long as the container is running. Once the container is stopped and removed, all the associated data will be lost. This is because Docker containers are designed to be stateless by nature.

This temporary or short-lived storage is called the “ephemeral container file system”. It is an essential feature of Docker, as it enables fast and consistent deployment of applications across different environments without worrying about the state of a container.

### Ephemeral FS and Data Persistence
As any data stored within the container’s ephemeral FS is lost when the container is stopped or removed, it poses a challenge to data persistence in applications. This is especially problematic for applications like databases, which require data to be persisted across multiple container life cycles.

To overcome these challenges, Docker provides several methods for data persistence, such as:

- Volumes: A Docker managed storage option, stored outside the container’s FS, allowing data to be persisted across container restarts and removals.
- Bind mounts: Mapping a host machine’s directory or file into a container, effectively sharing host’s storage with the container.
- tmpfs mounts: In-memory storage, useful for cases where just the persistence of data within the life-cycle of the container is required.
