## Docker CLI
The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with and manage Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks. It provides a wide range of commands for users to create, run, and manage Docker containers and other Docker resources in their development and production workflows.

In this topic, we’ll dive into some key aspects of Docker CLI, covering the following:

1. Installation
To get started with Docker CLI, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide for your respective operating system from the Docker documentation.

2. Basic Commands
Here are some essential Docker CLI commands to familiarize yourself with:

- docker run: Create and start a container from a Docker image
- docker container: List running containers
- docker image: List all available images on your system
- docker pull: Pull an image from Docker Hub or another registry
- docker push: Push an image to Docker Hub or another registry
- docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile
- docker exec: Run a command in a running container
- docker logs: Show logs of a container
3. Docker Run Options
docker run is one of the most important commands in the Docker CLI. You can customize the behavior of a container using various options, such as:

- -d, --detach: Run the container in the background
- -e, --env: Set environment variables for the container
- -v, --volume: Bind-mount a volume
- -p, --publish: Publish the container’s port to the host
- --name: Assign a name to the container
- --restart: Specify the container’s restart policy
- --rm: Automatically remove the container when it exits
4. Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions to build a Docker image. You can use the Docker CLI to build, update, and manage Docker images using a Dockerfile.

Here is a simple example of a Dockerfile:
```
# Set the base image to use
FROM alpine:3.7

# Update the system and install packages
RUN apk update && apk add curl

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application file
COPY app.sh .

# Set the entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["./app.sh"]
```
To build the image, use the command:
```
docker build -t my-image .
```
5. Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a CLI tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications using YAML files. It works together with the Docker CLI, offering a consistent way to manage multiple containers and their dependencies.

Install Docker Compose using the official installation guide, and then you can create a docker-compose.yml file to define and run multi-container applications:
```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: webapp-image
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  database:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw
```
Run the application using the command:
```
docker-compose up
```

## Containers
Containers can be thought of as lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, ensuring that it works uniformly across different environments.

### Why Use Containers?
- Portability: Containers ensure that applications work consistently across different platforms, be it a developer’s laptop or a production server. This eliminates the “it works on my machine” problem.

- Efficiency: Containers are lightweight since they use shared resources without the overhead of a full-fledged operating system. This enables faster startup times and reduces resource usage.

- Scalability: Containers can be effortlessly scaled up or down according to the workload, making it ideal for distributed applications and microservices.

- Consistency: Containers enable developers, QA, and operations teams to have a consistent environment throughout the application lifecycle, leading to faster and smoother deployment pipelines.

- Security: Containers provide a level of isolation from other containers and the underlying host system, which aids in maintaining application security.

### Working with Containers using Docker CLI
Docker CLI offers several commands to help you create, manage, and interact with containers. Some common commands include:

- docker run: Used to create and start a new container.

- docker container ls: Lists running containers.

- docker container stop: Stops a running container.

- docker container rm: Removes a stopped container.

- docker exec: Executes a command inside a running container.

- docker logs: Fetches the logs of a container, useful for debugging issues.

## Docker Images
Docker images are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run an application. These images contain all necessary dependencies, libraries, runtime, system tools, and code to enable the application to run consistently across different environments.

Docker images are built and managed using Dockerfiles. A Dockerfile is a script that consists of instructions to create a Docker image, providing a step-by-step guide for setting up the application environment.

### Working with Docker Images
Docker CLI provides several commands to manage and work with Docker images. Some essential commands include:

- docker image ls: List all available images on your local system.
- docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
- docker image rm: Remove one or more images.
- docker pull: Pull an image from a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) to your local system.
- docker push: Push an image to a repository.

For example, to pull the official Ubuntu image from Docker Hub, you can run the following command:
```
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```
After pulling the image, you can create and run a container using that image with the docker run command:
```
docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```
This command creates a new container and starts an interactive session inside the container using the /bin/bash shell.

### Sharing Images
Docker images can be shared and distributed using container registries, such as Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Once your images are pushed to a registry, others can easily access and utilize them.

To share your image, you first need to tag it with a proper naming format:
```
docker tag <image-id> <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```
Then, you can push the tagged image to a registry using:
```
docker push <username>/<repository>:<tag>
```

## Docker Networks
Docker networks provide an essential way of managing container communication. It allows containers to talk to each other and to the host machine using various network drivers. By understanding and utilizing different types of network drivers, you can design container networks to accommodate specific scenarios or application requirements.

### Network Drivers
There are several network drivers available in Docker. Here, we will cover four of the most common ones:

- bridge: The default network driver for containers. It creates a private network where containers can communicate with each other and the host machine. Containers on this network can access external resources via the host’s network.
- host: This driver removes network isolation and allows containers to share the host’s network. It is useful for cases where network performance is crucial, as it minimizes the overhead of container networking.
- none: This network driver disables container networking. Containers using this driver run in an isolated environment without any network access.
- overlay: This network driver enables containers deployed on different hosts to communicate with each other. It is designed to work with Docker Swarm and is perfect for multi-host or cluster-based container deployments.
### Managing Docker Networks
Docker CLI provides various commands to manage the networks. Here are a few useful commands:
```
- List all networks: docker network ls
- Inspect a network: docker network inspect <network_name>
- Create a new network: docker network create --driver <driver_type> <network_name>
- Connect containers to a network: docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
- Disconnect containers from a network: docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>
- Remove a network: docker network rm <network_name>
```

## Docker Volumes
Docker volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow you to separate the data from the container itself, making it easy to backup, migrate, and manage your persistent data.

### Why Volumes are Important
Docker containers are ephemeral by nature, meaning they can be stopped, deleted, or replaced easily. While this is great for application development and deployment, it poses a challenge when dealing with persistent data. That’s where volumes come in. They provide a way to store and manage the data separately from the container’s lifecycle.

### Types of Volumes
There are three types of volumes in Docker:

- Host Volumes: They are stored on the host machine’s filesystem, usually in the /var/lib/docker/volumes directory. These can be easily accessed, but can pose issues with portability or file system compatibility.

- Anonymous Volumes: These are created automatically when a container is run without specifying a volume. Their ID is generated by Docker and they are also stored on the host machine’s filesystem.

- Named Volumes: Similar to anonymous volumes, named volumes are stored on the host machine’s filesystem. However, you can provide a custom name, making it easy to reference in other containers or for backups.

### Volume Management with Docker CLI
Docker CLI provides various commands to manage volumes:

- docker volume create: Creates a new volume with a given name.
- docker volume ls: Lists all volumes on the system.
- docker volume inspect: Provides detailed information about a specific volume.
- docker volume rm: Removes a volume.
- docker volume prune: Removes all unused volumes.

To use a volume in a container, you can use the -v or --volume flag during the docker run command. For example:
```
docker run -d --name my-container -v my-named-volume:/var/lib/data my-image
```
This command creates a new container named “my-container” using the “my-image” image and mounts the “my-named-volume” volume at the /var/lib/data path inside the container.
