# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sara', 'Susan']

# Simple for loop
for person in people:
  print(f'Current Person: {person}')

# Break
for person in people:
  if person == 'Sara':
    break
  print(f'Current Person: {person}')

# Continue
for person in people:
  if person == 'Sara':
    continue
  print(f'Current Person: {person}')

# range
for i in range(len(people)):
  print(people[i])

for i in range(0, 11):
  print(f'Number: {i}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

count = 0
while count < 10:
  print(f'Count: {count}')
  count += 1


"""IF statement

@see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html

There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is
short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation.

An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found
in other languages.
