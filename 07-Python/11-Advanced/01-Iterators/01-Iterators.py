#Iterating Through an Iterator
#In Python, we can use the next() function to return the next item in the sequence.



# define a list
my_list = [4, 7, 0]

# create an iterator from the list
iterator = iter(my_list)

# get the first element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 4

# get the second element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 7

# get the third element of the iterator
print(next(iterator))  # prints 0




"""Here, first we created an iterator from the list using the iter() method. And then used the next() function to retrieve 
the elements of the iterator in sequential order.

When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, we will get the StopIteration Exception."""

#Using for Loop:-A more elegant way of automatically iterating is by using the for loop. For example,

# define a list
my_list = [4, 7, 0]

for element in my_list:
    print(element)



#Working of for loop for Iterators
"""The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, or string.

When we use the for loop with an iterator, the loop will automatically iterate over the elements of the iterator until it is exhausted.
"""

# create a list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# create an iterator from the list
iterator = iter(my_list)

# iterate through the elements of the iterator
for element in iterator:

    # Print each element
    print(element)





#Building an iterator from scratch is easy in Python. We just have to implement the __iter__() and the __next__() methods,

# __iter__(): The iter() method is called for the initialization of an iterator. This returns an iterator object
# __next__(): The next method returns the next value for the iterable. When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, 
# internally it uses the iter() method to get an iterator object, which further uses the next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration


"""__iter__() returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.
__next__() must return the next item in the sequence. On reaching the end, and in subsequent calls, it must raise StopIteration.
Let's see an example that will give us the next power of 2 in each iteration. Power exponent starts from zero up to a user set number,"""
