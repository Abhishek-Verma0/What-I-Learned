'''In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

How to create a class
To define a class in Python, you can use the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, an __init__ method has to be defined with def. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects. It's similar to a constructor in Java. __init__ must always be present! It takes one argument: self, which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the pass keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there. Remember to use correct indentation!
