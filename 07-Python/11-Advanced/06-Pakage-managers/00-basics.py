"""Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

PyPI and Pip are the most common contenders but here are some other options available as well:

Poetry : Manages dependencies via isolation
PIPX : Isolation-based app deployment, so you donâ€™t have to affect the system or user PIP libraries. It enables you to try individual python CLI tools without affecting other dependencies.
