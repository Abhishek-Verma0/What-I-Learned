"""Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

Some prefer saying Software testing definition as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application Under Test (AUT). This Software Testing course introduces testing software to the audience and justifies the importance of software testing.

Testing Strategies in Software Engineering
Here are important strategies in software engineering:

Unit Testing: This software testing basic approach is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developers to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.

Integration testing: It focuses on the construction and design of the software. You need to see that the integrated units are working without errors or not.

System testing: In this method, your software is compiled as a whole and then tested as a whole. This testing strategy checks the functionality, security, portability, amongst others."""
