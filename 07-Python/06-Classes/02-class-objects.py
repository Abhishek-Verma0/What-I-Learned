"""Class Definition Syntax.

@see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects

After defining the class attributes to a class, the class object can be created by assigning the
object to a variable. The created object would have instance attributes associated with it.

    Class objects support two kinds of operations:

    - instantiation.

    # ATTRIBUTE REFERENCES use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in
    # Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace
    # when the class object was created. For class MyCounter the following references are valid
    # attribute references:

    # CLASS INSTANTIATION uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a

    # (assuming the above class):

    # The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes
    # like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a
    # class may define a special method named __init__(), like this:

#Example of Python Class and object
#Creating an object in Python involves instantiating a class to create a new instance of that class. This process is also referred to as object instantiation.


# Python3 program to
# demonstrate instantiating
# a class
class Dog:
 
    # A simple class
    # attribute
    attr1 = "mammal"
    attr2 = "dog"
 
    # A sample method
    def fun(self):
        print("I'm a", self.attr1)
        print("I'm a", self.attr2)
 
 
# Driver code
# Object instantiation
Rodger = Dog()
 
# Accessing class attributes
# and method through objects
print(Rodger.attr1)
Rodger.fun()





#Self Parameter
#When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) – this is all the special self is about. 


class GFG:
    def __init__(self, name, company):
        self.name = name
        self.company = company
 
    def show(self):
        print("Hello my name is " + self.name+" and I" +
