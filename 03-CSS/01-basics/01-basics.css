There are three ways to write CSS 
        1. Inline CSS. The inline CSS helps to style and customize HTML elements individually. 
        2. Internal CSS. The internal CSS is implemented in the <head> section of the HTML document page using the      <style> tag.
        3. External CSS. The external CSS is stored in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
