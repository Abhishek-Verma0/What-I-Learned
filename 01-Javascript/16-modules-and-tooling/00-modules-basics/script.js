//As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù. A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.
/*To name some (for historical reasons):
/*A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
import allows the import of functionality from other modules.
For instance, if we have a file sayHi.js exporting a function:
*/
// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
//‚Ä¶Then another file may import and use it:

// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';

alert(sayHi); // function...
sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!




1.AMD ‚Äì one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library require.js.
2.CommonJS ‚Äì the module system created for Node.js server.
3.UMD ‚Äì one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS. */
