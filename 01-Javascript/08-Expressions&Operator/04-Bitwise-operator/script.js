/*Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bits (zeros & ones) and work on the level of their binary representation. Ex. Decimal number 9 has a binary representation of 1001. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

Bitwise operators in JavaScript are as follows:

& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (Left SHIFT)
>> (Right SHIFT)
>>> (Zero-Fill Right SHIFT) */
